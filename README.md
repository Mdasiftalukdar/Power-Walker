# Power-Walker
Power Walker - power generation using piezoelectric transducers with pressure mechanism support. In this project, 
round shape of the piezoelectric transducers with the size of 
35 mm in diameter were used which takes foot pressure in 
the form of kinetic energy and convert it into electrical 
energy.
